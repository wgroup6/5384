### Scope

Facilitate the sharing of thoughts and artefacts about the vaccinations
and vaccination certificates.

### Introduction

#### Objective

To provide a minimal but not exhaustive immunization data set with
business requirements and demonstrate their use for key use cases.

#### Business needs

  - Existing messaging standards do not provide enough detail.

  - Business and technical stakeholders need a common understanding of
    the data elements and related requirements by use case to
    effectively adopt within digital health solutions.

  - Must align with IPS and support FHIR implementations.
